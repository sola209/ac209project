                Development of recommender systems based on user ratings and reviews is an area of major research.
                We present and evaluate methods for implementing systems that can recommend books to users reliably and efficiently,
                through analyzing Amazon Kindle Store review data to understand what types of users correlate strongest with groups of products.

                <h3>Method 1: User-based Collaborative Filtering</h3>
                <p>The collaborative filtering model inputs a user ID and identifies that user’s position in a
                    similarity matrix comprising 5000 randomly sampled users from the original universe of Amazon kindle reviewers.
                    Matrix entries correspond to the scores users assigned to products, and for a given input user,
                    the model calculates the user-row’s cosine similarity to all other rows in the matrix. Finally,
                    with the given user’s most similar users on hand, the model recommends items liked by those users
                    for final consideration.</p>

                <h3>Method 2: Item-based Network Filtering</h3>
                <p>The related-products model considers all positively reviewed products that, according to Amazon metadata,
                    were either also viewed or also purchased alongside any product positively reviewed by a given input user.
                    These items are ordered by review positivity and recommended to the user.

            <h3>Hybrid Model</h3>
            <p>The hybrid model outputs the intersection of the book lists generated by each model and orders them by

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            The text from each user's set of reviews was used as one method for determining similarity between users.
            The following process was used to complete the text analysis:
            <ol>
                <li>The dataset was grouped by user, and for each user, text from all reviews was combined into one block of text.</li>
                <li>A count vectorizer was used to get counts of all words in each block of text.
                    A list of standard English stop words was used to remove very common words and prepositions from the text.</li>
                <li>Text was cleaned of all html entities.</li>
                <li>The result of the above is a "utility matrix" of users as rows and word counts as columns.</li>
                <li>Next, the TF-IDF score was calculated for each word, such that the word counts in the utility matrix were updated with these scores.</li>
                <li>The cosine similarity between each pair of users was calculated using their vectors of TF-IDF scores.</li>

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>
              <p>Improving on Simple Averaging for Kindle Ratings Predictions proved difficult.
                  After investigating a range of models such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, we
                  lowered RMSE by 3% from the Simple Averaging baseline.  However the Netflix Challenge helps us
                  frame the significance of this improvement: Netflix waited 3 years and paid $1mm for a 10%
                  improvement from a model that wasn’t much better than Simple Averaging.  Considering the sparsity of
                  the dataset and the less-variability in ratings, difficulty in improving on RMSE is understandable.
              </p>
              <p>While less quantifiably measurable, item recommendations proved more fruitful.
                  Relying on item metadata and user-based collaborative filtering to make recommendations,
                  we found considerable overlap among recommendations found using either strategy. While the user-based
                  recommendation model was able to leverage common user opinions based on product ratings, the item-based
                  model examined a the broader universe of available products. The intersection of these two strategies
                  balances similarity based on reviews as well as the user’s broader genre preferences.</p>

              <p>
                  To evaluate the efficacy of the two strategies, we must consider the trade-off between the model’s
                  ability to recommend novel items, and our ability to evaluate model performance. While the accuracy
                  of the Simple Averaging model is easily quantifiable, the collaborative filtering methods are not.

                <h3>Future Work</h3>
                <p><strong>Computational efficiency:</strong> The Amazon Kindle dataset encodes information for
                    ~62,000 users and ~68,000 products. Due to memory and processing constraints, all of our present
                    models sample a small subset of this information. In order to increase the volume of information
                    available to the model, we will need to encode this data using a sparse matrix representation and
                    use matrix operations in our predictive calculations.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Integrating Text Analysis and User-based Collaborative Filtering:</strong>
                    We are currently calculating user similarity matrices separately for the user-based collaborative
                    filtering model and for the text analysis model. We’d like to create a model that combines these
                    two approaches, and uses the similarity matrices from both models. For example, we could calculate
                    the N most similar users from the text model, and the N most similar users from the collaborative
                    filtering approach, and take the union of those two sets as the final similarity matrix. We can then
                    test to see if this mixed model improves the accuracy of our rating predictions.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Machine Learning Approach:</strong> We haven’t yet tried implementing a machine
                    learning based approach. The Stanford article on recommender systems
                    (http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch9.pdf ) suggested an approach involving
                    creating a decision tree for each user, in which the predictors are attributes of
                    the item as shown in the below diagram. In our case, we could use book attributes
                    from the metadata dataset as the predictors.
                </p>

                <p> <strong>Matrix Factorization:</strong> Given the size of our dataset, speed is a
                    consideration for our predictive models.  Matrix Factorization is a relatively quick model
                    that works well with this sort of recommendation problem. This would be a good initial enhancement from our baseline models.
