                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The Netflix Challenge, which completed in 2009, sparked significant research interest in
                    recommendation systems based on user ratings and reviews. Rather than movies, we present and
                    evaluate methods for recommending another favorite pasttime: books.  Illustrating the significance
                    of this research, the Amazon Kindle market alone rivals that of Netflix by size ($5bn vs. $6bn).
                    In our study, we recommend Kindle books to users reliably and efficiently, through analyzing
                    Amazon Kindle Store review data to understand what types of users correlate strongest with
                    groups of products. <br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The Netflix Challenge also provides useful context and motivation for this project, as the Kindle data
                    is both more sparse and less varied. As the following pie graphs demonstrate, ratings are disproportionately
                    skewed towards the 4 and 5-star ratings categories, re-emphasizing the need for product and user
                    behaviour-based approaches to recommendation.

                <p> The following datasets were consulted in the preparation of this report: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Amazon Kindle Store <strong>Ratings and Reviews:</strong> Includes ~1 million records of ratings, with
                        complete review text, timestamp, product ID, rating out of 5 and user ID for each review.
                        The dataset is automatically filtered to only include users that have reviewed at least five
                        products, and products that have at been reviewed at least five times each.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Amazon Kindle Store <strong>Product Metadata:</strong> Includes ~500,000 records of product, with
                        the name, product ID, description, price, category, and items that were also bought and also viewed
                        for each recorded product.

                user's perspective.</p>

            <center><p class='collabbox'>This section describes methods pertaining to previously unseen book recommendations
            given an input user. This model is constructed using a hybrid model of two recommendation modules described
            below in detail: user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. The intersection set of books outputted by
            both models form the final recommendations, and are ordered by their overall popularity in the dataset by
            average review.</p></center>

              <div class="col-md-6 column">

                  <h3>Method 1: User-based Collaborative Filtering</h3>
                  <p>The user-based collaborative filtering model inputs a user ID and identifies that user’s position in a
                      similarity matrix comprising 5000 randomly sampled users from the original universe of Amazon kindle reviewers.
                      Matrix entries correspond to the scores users assigned to products, and for a given input user,
                      the model calculates the user-row’s cosine similarity to all other rows in the matrix. Finally,
                      with the given user’s most similar users on hand, the model recommends items liked by those users
                      for final consideration.</p>

                  <p>This is done by filtering products of the most similar users to those that were positively reviewed
                  by that user. The intersection set of liked products across all similar users is outputted to the input
                  user for recommendation. What is important to note is that the list is unordered, as the final recommendation
                  list is ordered after hybridization is completed.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6 column">

                  <h3>Method 2: Item-based Network Filtering</h3>
                  <p>
                      The item-based collaborative filtering model begins with the products that were most liked by an
                      input user. These products are then cross-referenced with all products from the meta-dataset that
                      were either also bought or also viewed with those products. Finally, this new "universe of products"
                      is filtered by those that, on average, were positively reviewed across all users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The products from this final set that have not already been reviewed by the user are outputted for
                      final recommendation.

              <h3>Hybrid Model</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The hybrid model outputs the intersection of the book lists generated by each model and orders them by
                  their average score in the total dataset of Amazon kindle reviews, comprising almost 1,000,000 reviews.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  One evident drawback of this hybrid model is that the intersection output, shown in the graph below in
                  yellow, is quite small. We can understand from this histogram that the recommendation sets outputted from
                  the user-based collaborative filtering model are generally smaller than those outputted by the item-based
                  filtering model, indicating that the intersection set is primarily limited in size by the user similarity
                  matrix, which currently only supports 5,000 users due to computational intensity. Strategies to circumvent
                  this drawback and further improve the quality of the final intersection set are mentioned in the conclusions
                  section below.
              </p>

                  Another important opportunity to recognize is that of integrating the two methods more conceptually, as
                  opposed to simply taking the final intersection set. For example, for products in the universe of a user's
                  positively reviewed products according to the metadata, items can be filtered by positive reviews from
                  users most similar to the input user according to the similarity matrix, as opposed to the entire dataset.

                <h3>Methods Considered</h3>
                <p>Root-Mean-Square-Deviation (RSME) is our main performance metric defined as per below:</p>
                <div style="text-align:center"><img style="width: 35%"src="images/RatingsPredict/RMSE.png"/></div>

                <p>The following four approaches were used for Ratings Prediction for a given User-Iterm pair.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Simple Average: </strong>Baseline models using a combination of Train Data's Total Population Avg., Item Avg., and User Avg. Rating</li>
                    <li><strong>Ratings-based User-based collaborative filtering: </strong>Predicts user ratings based on the ratings of similar users, where similarity is based on ratings history</li>
                    <li><strong>Review-based User-based collaborative filtering: </strong>Predicts user ratings based on the ratings of similar users, where similarity is based on review text</li>
                    <li><strong>Matrix Factorization: </strong> Finds latent features by factorizing user-item matrix</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We improved upon the Baseline Constant Average Predict model of .89 with an ensemble collaborative filtering model that led to a RMSE of .73.
                Of note, the Simple Averaging model produced an impressive RMSE of .75.  Difficulty to improve upon this method is due to the data's low variance and high sparsity. The Kindle
                data is in fact 51x less-filled (more sparse) than the Netflix Data.</p>

                <h3>Constant Prediction: Train Total Average</h3>

                <p>The initial baseline is to simply predict the average of all the train data ratings. For the total population, the Average Kindle Rating was a very high 4.4 (in comparison, Netflix's average rating was 3.7).  This simple method already
                    achieves a low RMSE of .89 (as illustrated below). Note, for the Netflix challenge, teams were trying to achieve
                    an RMSE of .855.  This again illustrates the lack of variance within this data.</p>

                <h3>Weighted Average: Item and User Avg. Rating</h3>
                <p>An improved baseline is to use a weighted sum of Item and User Average Rating.
                    The below graph shows that the User Avg. Rating is more valuable than the Item Avg. Rating.
                    Specifically, the optimal combination of the two ratings is 20% Item Avg. and 80% User Avg.  This method achieves an RMSE of .75. Logically, given low variance of data and sparsity of data,
                    surpassing this already low baseline is quite difficult.</p>

                <h3>Traditional User-based Collaborative Filtering</h3>
                <p>In addition to using user-based collaborative filtering for generating recommendations, it can also
                    be used to predict a user's rating for any book. The basic idea of this approach is that for a given
                    user, the model will find similar users and use the ratings of the similar users to predict the rating
                    of the first user. </p>

                <p>For this model, a dataset of approximately 1000 frequent reviewers was used. For each of these users,
                    a similarity matrix was generated to represent the similarity between each pair of user. Similarity was calculated by taking the cosine similarity
                    of each user's vector of ratings for all books. Finally, in order to calculate the predicted rating for a given user and book, the average
                    rating for that user across all books was added to a normalized average of all other users' ratings
                    for the given book, weighted by the similarity of the user. In this way, users that are most
                    similar have the most significant influence on the prediction. </p>

                <h3>User-based Collaborative Filtering with Text Analysis</h3>
                This approach is identical to user-based collaborative filtering, except that rather than calculating
                user-to-user similarity from rating history, it was calculated from review text.
                The following process was used to complete the text analysis:
                <ol>
                    <li>The dataset was grouped by user, and for each user, text from all reviews was combined into one block of text.</li>
                    <li>A count vectorizer (defined below) was used to extract counts of all words in each block of text.
                        A list of standard English stop words was used to remove very common words and prepositions from the text.</li>
                    <li>Text was cleaned of all html entities.</li>
                    <li>The result of the above is a "utility matrix" of users vs. word counts.</li>
                    <li>Next, the TF-IDF score (defined below) was calculated for each word, such that the word counts in the utility matrix were updated with these scores.</li>
                    <li>The cosine similarity between each pair of users was calculated using their vectors of TF-IDF scores.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Methods for Determining Text Attributes</h3>
                <p><strong>Count Vectorizer: </strong> Converts text from each review into a matrix of word counts.</p>
                <p><strong>Term Frequency (TF): </strong>The frequency of a word in a document. Usually this log form is used.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Inverse Document Frequency:</strong>The inverse of the document frequency -- that is, the ratio of total documents/items to the number of items where some attribute is present. Usually the log of this ratio is used.
                </p>
                <p><strong>TF-IDF: </strong>The term frequency multipled by the inverse document frequency. Overall this
                represents how often a word was used by user, and how unique that word is - indicating how significant
                    it is that a given word appeared in a user's set of reviews.</p>

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>
              <p>Improving on Simple Averaging for Kindle Ratings Predictions proved difficult.
                  After investigating a range of models such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, we
                  lowered RMSE by 3% from the Simple Averaging baseline.  However the Netflix Challenge helps us
                  frame the significance of this improvement: Netflix waited 3 years and paid $1mm for a 10%
                  improvement from a model that was not much better than Simple Averaging.  Considering the sparsity of
                  the dataset and the less-variability in ratings, difficulty in improving on RMSE is understandable.
              </p>

              <p>While less quantifiably measurable, item recommendations proved more fruitful.
                  Relying on item metadata and user-based collaborative filtering to make recommendations,
                  we found considerable overlap among recommendations found using either strategy. While the user-based
                  recommendation model was able to leverage common user opinions based on product ratings, the item-based
                  model examined a the broader universe of available products. The intersection of these two strategies
                  balances similarity based on reviews as well as the user’s broader genre preferences.</p>

              <p>
                  To evaluate the efficacy of the two strategies, we must consider the trade-off between the model’s
                  ability to recommend novel items, and our ability to evaluate model performance. While the accuracy
                  of the Simple Averaging model is easily quantifiable, the collaborative filtering methods are not.

                <h3>Future Work</h3>
                <p><strong>Computational efficiency:</strong> The Amazon Kindle dataset encodes information for ~62,000 users and ~68,000 products.
                    Due to memory and processing constraints, some of our present models sample a subset of
                    this information (between 1k-10k of the total users depending on the model).
                    Baseline Averaging Models and Matrix Factorization were completed using the full dataset by
                    converting data into sparse matrix representations.  However when comparing methodologies we used
                    the same data subset, to insure our comparisons were valid. For future research, improving our
                    computational efficiency through data structures suited for sparse data would be valuable.

                <p><strong>Machine Learning Approach:</strong> Another interesting approach to this problem is a machine
                    learning based approach. <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch9.pdf">This chapter</a> on recommender systems suggests a technique involving
                    creating decision trees for each user, in which the predictors are attributes of
                    the item as shown in the below diagram. In our case, we could use book attributes
                    from the metadata dataset as the predictors.
